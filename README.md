# Project Portuguese Bank


  The Portuguese Bank's customers haven't investigated enough for long term deposits, which that leads to revenue decline. To fix the issue, the bank will be identified the customers who have chance to subscribe for long-term deposit. Then, the marketing campaign will be focused on those customers.
