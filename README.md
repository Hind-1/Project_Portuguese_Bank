# Project Portuguese Bank(Classification)

  In statistics, the logistic model (or logit model) is used to model the probability of a certain class or event existing such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick. This can be extended to model several classes of events.

  The Portuguese Bank's customers haven't investigated enough for long term deposits, which that leads to revenue decline. To fix the issue, the bank will be identified the customers who have chance to subscribe for long-term deposit. Then, the marketing campaign will be focused on those customers.
  
  The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be subscribed ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.
