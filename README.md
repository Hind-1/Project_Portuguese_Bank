# Project Portuguese Bank


  The Portuguese Bank's customers haven't investigated enough for long term deposits, which that leads to revenue decline. To fix the issue, the bank will be identified the customers who have chance to subscribe for long-term deposit. Then, the marketing campaign will be focused on those customers. 

  The data is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be subscribed ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.
There are two datasets: test.csv with all observations (32950) and 16 inputs including the target feature.
